This repository contains my solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.  
The aim is to practice **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **problem-solving skills** while keeping track of progress.

## 📂 Sample Repository Structure

```
.
├── arrays/
│   ├── two_sum.java
│   ├── maximum_subarray.java
│   └── ...
├── twoPinters/
│   ├── IsSubsequence.java
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

Each folder groups problems by leetcode-75 sections (e.g., `arrays`, `twoPinters`, `slidinWindow`).  
Filenames follow the problem name (snake_case / camelCase) for readability.

---

## 🛠 Languages Used

- **Java** (primary)
- (Optional) Python / Go / C++ (for the rare occasions of when I solve in multiple languages)

---

## ✅ Progress

- **Total Problems Solved:1**
- **Easy:1**
- **Medium:1**
- **Hard:0**

*(I generally update these numbers as I go.)*

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishek-karande/leetcode-solutions.git
   cd leetcode-solutions
   ```
2. Navigate to the src/main/java folder.
3. Run the solution (example in Java):
   ```bash
   javac <packageName>/className.java
   java <packageName>.<className>.java
   ```
Or use Intellij Idea 🙂

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen core **DSA** skills.
- Build muscle memory for **common patterns** (sliding window, two pointers, recursion, DP, etc.).
- Prepare for **coding interviews** at top tech companies.
